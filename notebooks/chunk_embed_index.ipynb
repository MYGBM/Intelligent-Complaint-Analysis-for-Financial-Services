    "### Chunking Approach\n",
    "Based on the EDA narrative length analysis:\n",
    "- **Median**: 114 words, **75th percentile**: 209 words\n",
    "- **Strategy**: Fixed-length chunking optimized for the embedding model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuration:**\n",
    "- **Chunk size**: 1,100 characters (~200 words)\n",
    "- **Chunk overlap**: 275 characters (~50 words)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "1. **Model constraint**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` has a 256-token limit (~190-200 words)\n",
    "2. **Coverage**: 200-word chunks capture 70-75% of complaints in a single chunk\n",
    "3. **Overlap**: 50-word overlap prevents semantic split at chunk boundaries\n",
    "4. **Context preservation**: Maintains full context for shorter complaints while handling long-tail cases\n",
